<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Hydrocele</h1>
<h3><marquee>Hydrocele refers to a fluid collection surrounding the testicle and is usually benign</marquee></h3>
<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">
<h3 class="third"> SYMPTOMS:</h3>
<p>In adult men, there may be a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. In some cases, the swelling might be worse in the morning than in the evening. It is not usually very painful.</p><p>

Seek medical treatment if you or your child has sudden or severe pain in their scrotum. This could be the sign of another condition called testicular torsion. Testicular torsion occurs when the testicles become twisted, typically due to an injury or accident. Testicular torsion isn’t common, but it’s a medical emergency because it can lead to blocked blood supply to the testicle and ultimately infertility if untreated. If you think you or child has testicular torsion, go a hospital emergency room right away or call 911. It needs to be evaluated and treated immediately.</p>


<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Towards the end of pregnancy, a male child’s testicles descend from his abdomen into the scrotum. The scrotum is the sac of skin that holds the testicles once they descend.</p><p>

During development, each testicle has a naturally occurring sac around it that contains fluid. Normally, this sac closes itself and the body absorbs the fluid inside during the baby’s first year. However, this doesn’t happen for babies with a hydrocele. Babies born prematurely are at a higher risk for hydrocele, according to the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>

Hydroceles can also form later in life, mostly in men over 40. This usually occurs if the channel through which the testicles descend hadn’t closed all the way and fluid now enters, or the channel reopens. This can cause fluid to move from the abdomen into the scrotum. Hydroceles can also be caused by inflammation or injury in the scrotum or along the channel. The inflammation may be caused by an infection (epididymitis) or another condition.</p>



<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>

<p>To diagnose a hydrocele, your doctor will perform a physical exam. If you have a hydrocele, your scrotum will be swollen, but you won’t have any pain. Your doctor won’t be able to feel your testicle well through the fluid-filled sac.</p><p>

Your doctor may check for tenderness in the scrotum and shine a light through the scrotum. This is called transillumination. It allows your doctor to determine if there’s fluid in the scrotum. If fluid is present, the scrotum will allow light transmission and the scrotum will appear to light up with the light passing through. However, if scrotal swelling is due to a solid mass (cancer), then the light will not shine through the scrotum. This test does not provide a definite diagnosis but can be very helpful.</p><p>

Your doctor may also apply pressure to the abdomen to check for another condition called inguinal hernia; your doctor may also ask you to cough or bear down to check for this. This can occur when part of the small intestine protrudes through the groin due to a weak point in the abdominal wall. While it’s usually not life-threatening, a doctor may recommend surgery to repair it.</p><p>

They may take a blood or urine sample to test for infections. Less commonly, your doctor may administer an ultrasound to check for hernias, tumors, or any other cause of scrotal swelling.
</p>

<h3 class="third">TREATMENT</h3>

<p>If your new infant has a hydrocele, it will probably go away on its own in about a year. If your child’s hydrocele doesn’t go away on its own or becomes very large, he might need surgery by a urologist.</p><p>

In adults, hydroceles typically go away within six months, according to the Mayo Clinic. A hydrocele usually only needs surgery if it causes discomfort or if it’s a communicating hydrocele, which can lead to hernias.</p>
